An implementation of the SWIRLDS HashGraph Consensus Algorithm as specified in [the
paper](https://www.swirlds.com/downloads/SWIRLDS-TR-2016-01.pdf).

##Usage
For now, you can just run the tests with ```cargo test```. The unit tests in the graph module are the necessary steps to
order all events topologically according to the HashGraph algorithm.
